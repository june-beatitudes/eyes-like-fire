- `bea-framework`: 2025 Framework 12 running NixOS (config [here](https://github.com/june-beatitudes/nix-config))
- `pantheon`: Home-lab cluster consisting of three Debian 13 KVM hypervisor nodes (`artemis`, `athena`, and `hestia`), hosting this site, my media server, and several other things

### Tools
- Fliptra: [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/) used as a digital multitool and as a development platform for BEATRIX

### Software

- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/): VPN service used for secure access to all devices remotely
- [Lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net/): Web server used on `pantheon` to serve this site
- [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/): Media server used on `pantheon` for my music

### Languages

Work is currently underway on versions of this site in both my non-native languages. My notes and vocabulary flashcards for Russian are available [on Github](https://github.com/june-beatitudes/russian-notes).

- English: Spoken natively - roughly General American, with some influences from growing up in south Texas
- French: Spoken at a B2 (conversational fluency) level - primarily Metropolitan French with some Quebecois influence
- Russian: Spoken at an A1 (beginner) level - primarily so-called "standard Russian", though it's quite early to tell
