- `bea-laptop`: Dell Precision 5570 running NixOS (config [here](https://github.com/june-beatitudes/nix-config))
- `hecate`: Home-lab cluster running Proxmox, hosting this site, my media server, and several other things

### Tools

### Software

- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/): VPN service used for secure access to all devices remotely

### Languages

Work is currently underway on versions of this site in both my non-native languages. My notes and vocabulary flashcards for Russian are available [on Github](https://github.com/june-beatitudes/russian-notes).

- English: Spoken natively - roughly General American, with some influences from growing up in south Texas
- French: Spoken at a B2 (conversational fluency) level - primarily Metropolitan French with some Quebecois influence
- Russian: Spoken at an A1 (beginner) level - primarily so-called "standard Russian", though it's quite early to tell
